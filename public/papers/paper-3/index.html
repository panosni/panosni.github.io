<p>This paper studies a tax lottery in Greece and documents an increase in VAT revenue. The lottery incentivises the use of electronic payments over cash to ﬁght tax evasion by allocating EUR 1 million in prizes every month. Tickets are awarded automatically when individuals complete retail transactions by electronic means. I exploit a superdraw at the start of the lottery in Christmas Eve 2017; participation was unanticipated and individuals could not inﬂuence their winning chances. I estimate that regional VAT revenue increased by 0.01% per additional winner (or by EUR 2,700 compared to a EUR 1,000 winning prize). This eﬀect can be explained through winners, who increased their electronic consumption by 14%. Lasting for ﬁve months, this channel alone cannot explain the entire VAT eﬀect. A second channel is documented through spillover eﬀects from winners to non-winners.
